# Pong
Remake of Pong in Java

## Overview
This remake of pong works as you would expect. The goal is to keep the ball from hitting your side of the screen by blocking it with your paddle.
The game can be played with one or two players, where the WASD keys control the player on the left and the up and down arrows control the player on 
the right. There are other options available on the bottom that will help adjust the difficulty.
